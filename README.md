Hi, I’m @jacob-spare.
I’m interested in python, bash, powershell, and Cybersecurity.
I’m currently learning python, and am also interested in writing in Golang.
I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects; anything to get more experience.

This repository has examples of scripts/projects I have worked on.
